# We Are The Discovery & Mastery Based Education Working Group.

- [Published Specs]()
- [Specs Source Repo]()

We are an open Working Group founded to develop specifications towards the design of educational programs based on discovery and mastery centered learning.
- Our aim is to develop open and complete specifications by which educational programs can be designed.
- Our focus is on what we call Discovery and Mastery Centered Learning, or DM centered learning for short.

It's early days and we've just begun.

Our specs are all early draft stage and very rough, but we think the orientation of our approach is a good one and we hope there are at least some good ideas there.

Go ahead and check out the Specs, and please feel free to post any ideas you have as Issues to the repo, or even give it a Pull Request if you'd like to contribute.
