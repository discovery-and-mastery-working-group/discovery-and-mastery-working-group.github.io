We are an open Working Group founded to develop specifications towards the design of educational programs based on discovery and mastery centered learning.
- Our aim is to develop open and complete specifications by which educational programs can be designed.
- Our focus is on what we call Discovery and Mastery Centered Learning, or DM centered learning for short.

It's early days and we've just begun.

Our specs are all early draft stage and very rough, but we think the orientation of our approach is a good one and we hope there are at least some good ideas there.

We're Free and Open Source
--------------------------

All our specifications and analysis published to the repo are licensed under the MIT Open Source Licence.

We welcome you to send us your ideas for how we can improve our specs.

You can even contribute directly to the project as a contributor or possibly join the Working Group proper!

And if you like what we've done but what to go your own way, that's great too.

Just head over to our source repo on GitHub and get stuck in.

Anyway that these ideas can grow, evolve and be used is good to is!
